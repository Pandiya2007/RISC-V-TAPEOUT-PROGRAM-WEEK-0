## Welcome to My VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Journey

This is Week 0 — environment setup, tool installation
, and an overview of the SoC tapeout flow.

## Week 0 Objectives
- Understand tapeout flow & program structure
- Install and verify open-source EDA tools
- Create a dedicated GitHub repo for documentation
- Capture learnings day-by-day

## ✅ Tasks Completed
| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 0 | Getting started with Digital VLSI SoC Design & Planning | ✅ Done |
| 1 | Installed Yosys (Logic synthesis) | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Installed Icarus Verilog (Simulation) | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Installed GTKWave (Waveform viewer) | ✅ Done |

## Tools Installed
- Yosys — Logic synthesis
- Icarus Verilog — Simulation
- GTKWave — Waveform viewing

## Week log
- `DAY0/README.md` — Tools installation steps & verification commands
- `DAY1/` — RTL exercises and notes
